Hello, I'm Damian Carrillo. 

I live in Austin, Texas in the U.S.A. I'm a software developer who specializes in iOS programming, yet I like to consider myself a generalist with skills in general software development. Currently, in my spare time I'm interested in the Rust programming language and re-learning web development using modern frameworks and tools.

I am also interested in audio processing and music production, so much so that I run a podcast with my wife called [Black and Brown Make Green](https://podcast.blackandbrownmakegreen.com/). It's not music production but the creative aspects scratch the same itch, at least for me.
